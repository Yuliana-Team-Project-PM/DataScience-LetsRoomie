## Install

Requirements for Python are inside ` requirements.txt` folder

To install requirements, you can run  `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Requirements for R are: R 3.5.1, `reticulate library`, `rmarkdown library`.

To install R requirements, you can run `install.package('rmarkdown')`, `install.package('reticulate')`. Then you must specify the path to the venv  where you install the python requirements. NOTE: In the first chunk (code block) of the .Rmd file is where you can change the path.

Is highly recommend to use Rstudio to run the .Rmd project.
